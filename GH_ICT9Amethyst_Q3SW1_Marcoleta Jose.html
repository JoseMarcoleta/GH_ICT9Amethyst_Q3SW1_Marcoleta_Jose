	<h3><b><i>Synopsis</i></b></h4>
	<p><b>Blue Lock is a series that follows the plight of high school soccer player Yoichi Isagi. A striker for his school team, he decides to pass to a teammate during the last moments of a game instead of taking a shot himself. This ultimately causes his team to lose the game. He’s upset= by this, but when he gets home, a letter from the Japan Football Federation is waiting for him, inviting him to be part of a project known as Blue Lock. He is put into a prison-like facility with 299 other strikers from all over the country, and they are asked to compete for the chance to be the striker for the national team, and maybe finally lead the country to win a World Cup. The catch, though? If a player gets cut, they lose the chance to play on the national team. Forever.</b></p>
